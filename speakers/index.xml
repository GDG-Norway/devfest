I started to learn to code when I was 9 years old and started building robots when I was 10. I speak English, Turkish, and French. I am learning C++ and Python through online courses and also whilst building my projects. When I get the chance I really enjoy attending events, talking about my projects, and receiving feedback from all different people.</description></item><item><title>No way, JOSE!</title><link>/speakers/sam_bellen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/speakers/sam_bellen/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Google Developer Expert (GDE) who works as a developer evangelist at Auth0. At Auth0 we&amp;rsquo;re trying to make authentication and identification as easy as possible, while still keeping it secure.
After office hours, I like to play around with the web-audio API, and other &amp;ldquo;exotic&amp;rdquo; browser API&amp;rsquo;s. One of my side projects is a library to add audio effects to an audio input using JavaScript.
