This session will equip Flutter Developers with critical UI observation skills to drive insights required to build a stellar UI in Flutter, and that too, in minimum time.
In this Talk, I‚Äôll go over the User Interfaces of 2-3 most famous Mobile Apps. I‚Äôll handpick some of the core screens of these apps, explaining my observation on the UI elements for each of them, and then deconstructing each of those elements to their equivalent Flutter widgets and their collective placements and styling.</description></item><item><title>Tales of a Mobile DevOps</title><link>/sessions/mobile_devops/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/sessions/mobile_devops/</guid><description>There is a lot of material on developing mobile apps, but how about shipping it to the real world? In this session we will go through what is the role of a Mobile Infrastructure team and why is crucial to let your app reach your end users.
If you&amp;rsquo;re developing mobile apps, you probably know what&amp;rsquo;s one of your most important KPI: Store Rating.
In such an environment, speed is key.</description></item><item><title>Want more from your frontend framework! Re-thinking web dev experience</title><link>/sessions/want_more_from_your_frontend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/sessions/want_more_from_your_frontend/</guid><description>Do you also love creating useful (web)apps and get easily frustrated by any friction in the development process? I will compare Redux + REST with a full-stack, component-centric solution based on a graph API (think GraphQL) that I came to love. You might not be able to use the same framework - Fulcro - but you can still look for similar, more developer-friendly solutions that implement some of the same ideas and provide some of the same functionality.</description></item><item><title>A Multiplatform triathlon -- Kotlin through Android, iOS and web</title><link>/sessions/multiplatform_triatholin_in_kotlin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/multiplatform_triatholin_in_kotlin/</guid><description>Do you ever had the dream that you could develop for one platform and you could easily reuse the code and create an app on another platform? Yup, there&amp;rsquo;s Kotlin Multiplatform üôå
For several years now, we‚Äôve been trying to find new solutions on how we could develop a single project and run it on all platforms. We‚Äôve been seeing all types of solutions: some are web-based, others require you to learn a new language, and others even may require that you pay a monthly fee to use.</description></item><item><title>Angular Material Design</title><link>/sessions/angular_material_design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/angular_material_design/</guid><description>You may have heard of @angular/material, or added few in your project - but how can developers take advantage of Material to create cohesive applications? In this talk, we‚Äôll learn how to leverage Angular and Material Design to create standard theming, custom design systems, and explore what‚Äôs next in Angular Material Design.
I will be covering @angular/material and Material Design within Angular. Since these are both Google products, the Google team has a unique vantage of understanding how we can better leverage Material Design within our applications moving forwards.</description></item><item><title>Beyond ES6 - New things in JavaScript</title><link>/sessions/beyond_es6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/beyond_es6/</guid><description>From 2015, when ES6 was introduced, JavaScript has added new features to the language each year. ES6 is considered modern JavaScript, but that is now 5 years ago. What has happened in the last 5 years? Let me show you what&amp;rsquo;s new in JavaScript.
I will show code and explain how the new features from the last 5 releases can help us.
ES7/ES2016: includes, exponentiation
ES8/ES2017: async &amp;amp; await, String padding, Object values &amp;amp; entries</description></item><item><title>CI/CD for Serverless Applications on CloudRun</title><link>/sessions/serverless_on_cloudrun/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/serverless_on_cloudrun/</guid><description>This is a hands-on demo of building a CI/CD pipeline for a web application deployed as a Serverless app using CloudRun.
Serverless application deployment is becoming quite popular and when it comes to GCP - CloudRun is the goto product/solution. This talk describes deploying a web application on CloudRun and how you can integrate your build pipelines using Cloud Build for the same. The talk would cover an end-to-end demo from building a docker container, pushing to GCR and then linking your repository to CloudBuild and ultimately deploying to CloudRun.</description></item><item><title>Closing words</title><link>/sessions/__close/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/__close/</guid><description>Closing words of the day</description></item><item><title>Designing Fair Machine Learning Models</title><link>/sessions/fair_ml_models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/fair_ml_models/</guid><description>The talk illustrates different aspects of building fair models. It further exemplifies with different use-cases as to how different ML models (traditional and deep learning) can be built using different constraints and how we can choose the right KPI metrics to evaluate its fairness.
This talk will be co-presented with fellow ML GDE Charmi Chokshi.</description></item><item><title>Directives in Angular</title><link>/sessions/directives_in_angular/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/directives_in_angular/</guid><description>I will be talking about the types of directives that are available in Angular and the usecases for the same.</description></item><item><title>Help!
