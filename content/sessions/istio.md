In a distributed world, we are facing new challenges. Circuit-breaker, retry, timeout, blue-green deployment, A/B testing, pool-ejection... replace our old monolith problem.

Istio is here to help us in those points, and even more!

In this presentation, we will see the tooling provided by Istio which can replace the Netflix stack and some dedicated frameworks in our micro-services environment. With this, we will see new paradigms of development brought by Istio to deploy and operate application with resiliency.

We are gonna explore the architecture of Istio, its internal and the elements built in the release 1.7.0 and we will go beyond that and see how to customize some underlying elements, like the Envoy Proxy. We will also dig into the futur 1.8.0 version to see what will happen next in Istio world.

Note: Attendees are recommended to have platform experience, but do not need to know the subject beforehand.
