What if you could perform machine learning on the edge, i.e on your mobile device? This would mean that you no longer would need the roundtrip to the server, no data will leave the device and you don't even need an internet connection. In this session you will get an introduction to TensorFlow Lite so that you can use it in your own projects.

I will demonstrate how you can take a pre-trained model for image classification and convert it to TensorFlow Lite format. Then I will go through how to deploy to model to the device and finally talk a little bit about optimization options in order to reduce the model size.

The motivation for this presentation is to give mobile developers an introduction into how they can incorporate machine learning algorithms in their mobile apps.
