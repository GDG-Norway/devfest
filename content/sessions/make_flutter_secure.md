Security is one of the top concerns for Product Owners and higher management. This talk shows some cool ways you can look into as a developer to make your Flutter apps secure.

I will be sharing some tips for securing applications which include in-memory tokenization, using secure storages, some security rules for Firebase (maybe), securing the smaller app window, shared preferences, making secure https calls, hashing keys, obfuscation, etc.

Note: for this talk, attendees will need Flutter experience. But, they do not need to know the subject beforehand.
