"Flutter is more than just an engine, a set of widgets, and some tools; it also includes a large ecosystem of packages to add functionality to your apps beyond what comes out of the box" - Chris Sells, Google Product Manager - Flutter.

Today, the Flutter ecosystem has more than 12,000 packages and new packages are being added to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) everyday. As the Flutter package landscape is grows day by day, developers often find themselves searching endlessly for suitable packages and sometimes even end up reinventing the wheel.

* Flutter: A Quick Overview
* A Flutter Developer's Journey
* Gathering App Requirement 
* Searching for the right package (for widgets)
