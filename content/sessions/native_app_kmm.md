Many platforms are available that help to create a hybrid mobile app or to say Multiple Platform Apps with a single source. Each of them has its pros and cons, this area got a lot of attraction with the introduction of Flutter two years back and is expected to heat up again with KMM - Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile. 

In this talk, I would like to talk about KMM - Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, how to build an Android & iOS app using KMM.
