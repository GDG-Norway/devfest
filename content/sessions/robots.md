I am 14 years old and I have been coding and building robots since I was 9 years old. I have built 5 robots until now; ic4u and ic4u2- a robot guide dog for blind people, BB4All - a robot that is designed to help teachers and students and to prevent bullying. Hashmet the Android â€“ the Android robot and DO the droid from Starwars. 

In my session, I would like to talk about the technologies I have integrated into my robots such as Google Assistant API, Google Maps API, and Google AIY voice kit. My robots have AI capabilities such as voice recognition, image processing, voice commands, and sensor-based automated decision mechanisms. To be able to do that I used Google Cloud, Tensorflow, and Dialogflow platforms and libraries.
