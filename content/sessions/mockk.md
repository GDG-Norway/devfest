Mockito has been used in testing kotlin/android apps since long, however there is setup required and a lot of boilerplate code required to test certain kotlin components as well as a need to use other libraries like PowerMock for the features that Mockito doesnâ€™t support. In this session, let's explore Mockk, a mocking framework with first-class support for kotlin features that helps developers write unit tests easily as well as improve code coverage without having to do extra setup/ write boilerplate code or use other mocking frameworks.
