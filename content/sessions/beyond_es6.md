From 2015, when ES6 was introduced, JavaScript has added new features to the language each year. ES6 is considered modern JavaScript, but that is now 5 years ago. What has happened in the last 5 years? Let me show you what's new in JavaScript.

I will show code and explain how the new features from the last 5 releases can help us.

ES7/ES2016: includes, exponentiation

ES8/ES2017: async & await, String padding, Object values & entries

ES9/ES2018: Spread & Rest for object properties, Promise finally, Regex improvements

ES10/ES2019: flat & flatMap, fromEntries, Optional catch binding, trimStart & trimEnd

ES11/ES202020: Promise.allSettled, BigInt, Dynamic import, matchAll, Nullish coalescing, Optional chaining
