The Nobel prizes in economics for 2019 and 2021 have interesting implications for data science generally. In general you may from an already existing data set only state correlational findings and not causal. These two Nobel prizes however, highlight that there is under certain conditions possible to make causal hypotheses with some confidence from the data. Consider for example the classic question from marketing - "We've spent millions on this campaign, and we see sales increase. Is the sales increase because of the campaign or because of something else?". This talk briefly goes through how Google's Vertex AI provide us with the means to make such causal inferences.  

The talk is applicable to all audiences that have an interest in data science, google technology and statistics and requires no particular background.
