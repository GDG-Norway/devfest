There is a lot of material on developing mobile apps, but how about shipping it to the real world? In this session we will go through what is the role of a Mobile Infrastructure team and why is crucial to let your app reach your end users.

If you're developing mobile apps, you probably know what's one of your most important KPI: Store Rating.

In such an environment, speed is key. You want to be able to iterate fast and ship beautiful apps to your users frequently. But with growing mobile teams, this is becoming more and more challenging.

The Mobile DevOps imposes a prospective shift to the "classical" DevOps perspective. Tools and processes should be adapted to the mobile release flow. You need to have tools to monitor your application, rollout a feature safely, and react to incident and 1-star reviews.

Mobile DevOps engineers to the rescue. They play a fundamental role in adapting your development flow to deliver mobile apps to your end-users.

In this talk, I will share my experience as a Mobile DevOps engineer, some of my preferred tools, and some of the lessons learned while building mobile infrastructures.
