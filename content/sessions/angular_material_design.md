You may have heard of @angular/material, or added few <mat-components> in your project - but how can developers take advantage of Material to create cohesive applications? In this talk, we’ll learn how to leverage Angular and Material Design to create standard theming, custom design systems, and explore what’s next in Angular Material Design.

I will be covering @angular/material and Material Design within Angular. Since these are both Google products, the Google team has a unique vantage of understanding how we can better leverage Material Design within our applications moving forwards.

The audience can be beginner or intermediate, since many advanced developers have less knowledge on design systems. For novice developers, I will be introducing Angular Material Components and showing use cases, focusing on some of the newest and pre-released components our team is currently working on. These developers will be able to learn and walk away with the understanding of how to get started with Material in Angular. For more advanced developers or larger applications, I will discuss how Material Design in Angular saves time and contributes to the concept of universal theming, without asking individual developers or teams to worry about specific design assets, especially across large organizations.

I will also discuss theming (including the beloved Dark Theme) and how to implement custom design systems for Angular apps using Material. We will also cover accessibility, interaction, gestures and more complex usability within design systems. I will also look at the recently released Angular Roadmap and touch on how Angular Material Design will be changing moving forward. Finally, I would like to discuss forwards looking design within Angular as a whole.

My overall goal is to better expose developers and audiences to @angular/material.
