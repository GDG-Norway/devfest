Do you ever had the dream that you could develop for one platform and you could easily reuse the code and create an app on another platform? Yup, there's Kotlin Multiplatform ðŸ™Œ

For several years now, weâ€™ve been trying to find new solutions on how we could develop a single project and run it on all platforms. Weâ€™ve been seeing all types of solutions: some are web-based, others require you to learn a new language, and others even may require that you pay a monthly fee to use. It also comes with the drawback that all your UI depends on the framework implementation. So, if thereâ€™s a native update youâ€™ll need to wait until someone rewrites the widgets for you to update your app.

Kotlin multiplatform gives us a new solution. It focuses on sharing your business logic across all platforms, leaving the UI to be implemented natively. Since itâ€™s Kotlin, you can take full advantage of its language features - concise, safe, etc. Moreover, if youâ€™re coming from Android, you might already be familiarised with Kotlin. Even if youâ€™re an iOS developer, youâ€™ll see that itâ€™s quite similar to Swift.
