The Android community adopts Jetpack Compose more and more each day. But what about our widgets? 

In this talk, we will see how we can use “Glance” library to create app widgets. We will briefly talk about how to create “glanceable” UI using composables. We will also see how to use actions for user interactions. Finally, we will discuss about creating widgets with different kind of size modes.
