User Interfaces of famous Mobile Apps will be deconstructed to the basic Flutter widgets, which, when put together, can replicate those very UIs in Flutter! This session will equip Flutter Developers with critical UI observation skills to drive insights required to build a stellar UI in Flutter, and that too, in minimum time.

In this Talk, I’ll go over the User Interfaces of 2-3 most famous Mobile Apps. I’ll handpick some of the core screens of these apps, explaining my observation on the UI elements for each of them, and then deconstructing each of those elements to their equivalent Flutter widgets and their collective placements and styling.

This will be a good exercise for the audience, in a way that they’ll learn that even the most complex-looking applications can be cloned in Flutter. But most importantly, they’ll learn how to critically observe a full-fledged UI or screen for the purpose of building them in Flutter. Irrespective of their experience in Flutter, they will learn how to work with a UI/UX designer in translating their designs into a Flutter app.

I haven’t yet decided which apps I will analyse in this session, but upon receiving a confirmation of my session, I’ll most probably conduct a poll on Twitter or LinkedIn, letting the audience vote for which apps they want to see me review. However, the selected apps will have a varying level of complexity in terms of UI/UX, so I’ll start with the simplest one in this session and then gradually transition to the more complicated ones. Depending on the final apps that are selected, I might do a live coding session to clone one screen in Flutter, to stir things up and convince the audience that they can build the most beautiful yet complicated UIs in just a matter of minutes with Flutter.
