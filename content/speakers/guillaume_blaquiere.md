title: Security in serverless compute on Google Cloud â€“ take over the control of the infrastructure
---

Guillaume is a Google Developer Expert on Cloud Platform since 2019 and works at Accenture as Cloud Architect. 

Java developer for more than 15 years, and despite positions of responsibilities, he has always kept his wish to create, develop, discover and test new solutions, especially in the Cloud, the machine learning or Python and Go language. 

Innovation addict and Google Cloud 3x certified, writer and speaker in his free time, he's fascinated by the serverless solution and all the ""usual"" problems that it solves.

More generally, he likes helping people stuck on Google Cloud; you can find him on Stack Overflow (guillaume-blaquiere), Medium (@guillaume-blaquiere) and Twitter (@gblaquiere).
