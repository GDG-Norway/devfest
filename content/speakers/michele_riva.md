I'm a passionate and experienced software architect and Google Developer Expert from Milan, Italy.

I've worked as a software engineer and architect for almost ten years in product and consultancy companies, taking the best from both worlds.

In 2022, I've published my first book, "Real-World Next.js", where I talk about the web framework that changed forever the way we build web applications.

I'm currently working as a Senior Software Architect in NearForm while contributing to many open-source projects in different languages (TypeScript, Haskell, Golang), writing technical articles, and speaking to many international conferences.
