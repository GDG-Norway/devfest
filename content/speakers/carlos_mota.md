Android tech lead at WIT Software, he can easily be spotted there working on the company RCS solution. Carlos is enthusiastic for new technology and always trying to reach those last 20% of all of his side projects that seem to be really far away. He loves to share his knowledge with others either by giving talks, teaching, writing or getting a cold beer in the nearest pub. 

GDG Coimbra organizer and Kotlin evangelist, he also has a huge passion for travel, photography, space and the occasional run.
