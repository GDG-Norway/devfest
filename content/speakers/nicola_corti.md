Nicola Corti has been an Android Software Engineer since 2.2, and a Free and Open Source lover for as long as he remembers. He’s currently working as an Android Infrastructure Engineer at Spotify, building the audio experience for millions of Android users worldwide.

Nicola usually calls himself a ‘community addict’. He can’t survive without learning every day, sharing knowledge, and having fun with other developers. He’s also currently managing the GDG chapter in Stockholm and the one in Pisa.

In his free time, he also loves open-source, photography and running.
