I'm Google Developer Expert (GDE) who works as a developer evangelist at Auth0. At Auth0 we're trying to make authentication and identification as easy as possible, while still keeping it secure.

After office hours, I like to play around with the web-audio API, and other "exotic" browser API's. One of my side projects is a library to add audio effects to an audio input using JavaScript.
