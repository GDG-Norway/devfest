title: My Journey Of Building Robots
---

My name is Selin Alara Örnek, I am 14 years old and I am currently a student in the 9th grade at Irmak High School, Istanbul. I started to learn to code when I was 9 years old and started building robots when I was 10. I speak English, Turkish, and French. I am learning C++ and Python through online courses and also whilst building my projects. When I get the chance I really enjoy attending events, talking about my projects, and receiving feedback from all different people. I have 5 robots; ic4u, ic4u2, BB4All, Hashmet the Android and DO. In 2018 I won first prize with my robot ic4u in the hardware category at Coolest Projects International, Dublin. The same year I was also a finalist in the European Youth Awards Open Innovation category with ic4u. In October 2019 I was awarded the “European Digital Girl of the Year, 2019” award in the (11-14year old category) by the Ada Awards in Brussels. In November 2019 I mentioned as one of the world's “Devkid”’s in Google Developers Blog.  In May 2020, I also won the Microsoft Youth Tech Star Award in the Women Leaders in Technology Awards.
