title: My Journey Of Building Robots
---

My name is Selin Alara Örnek, I am 14 years old and I am currently a student in the 9th grade at Irmak High School, Istanbul. I started to learn to code when I was 9 years old and started building robots when I was 10. I speak English, Turkish, and French. I am learning C++ and Python through online courses and also whilst building my projects. When I get the chance I really enjoy attending events, talking about my projects, and receiving feedback from all different people. My motivation to be a part of GDG Devfest Norway is to be able to encourage and show other kids especially girls that technology is fun and its good to be able to use technology for human benefit.

I have 5 robots; ic4u, ic4u2, BB4All, Hashmet the Android and DO. In 2018 I won first prize with my robot ic4u in the hardware category at Coolest Projects International, Dublin. The same year I was also a finalist in the European Youth Awards Open Innovation category with ic4u. In October 2019 I was awarded the “European Digital Girl of the Year, 2019” award in the (11-14year old category) by the Ada Awards in Brussels. In November 2019 I mentioned as one of the world's “Devkid”’s in Google Developers Blog.  In May 2020, I also won the Microsoft Youth Tech Star Award in the Women Leaders in Technology Awards.
