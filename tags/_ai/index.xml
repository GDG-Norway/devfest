It further exemplifies with different use-cases as to how different ML models (traditional and deep learning) can be built using different constraints and how we can choose the right KPI metrics to evaluate its fairness.
This talk will be co-presented with fellow ML GDE Charmi Chokshi.</description></item><item><title>Machine learning on the edge using TensorFlow Lite</title><link>/sessions/ml_using_tensorflow_lite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/ml_using_tensorflow_lite/</guid><description>What if you could perform machine learning on the edge, i.e on your mobile device? This would mean that you no longer would need the roundtrip to the server, no data will leave the device and you don&amp;rsquo;t even need an internet connection. In this session you will get an introduction to TensorFlow Lite so that you can use it in your own projects.
I will demonstrate how you can take a pre-trained model for image classification and convert it to TensorFlow Lite format.</description></item><item><title>My Journey Of Building Robots</title><link>/sessions/robots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/robots/</guid><description>I am 14 years old and I have been coding and building robots since I was 9 years old. I have built 5 robots until now; ic4u and ic4u2- a robot guide dog for blind people, BB4All - a robot that is designed to help teachers and students and to prevent bullying. Hashmet the Android â€“ the Android robot and DO the droid from Starwars.
In my session, I would like to talk about the technologies I have integrated into my robots such as Google Assistant API, Google Maps API, and Google AIY voice kit.</description></item></channel></rss>
