Serverless application deployment is becoming quite popular and when it comes to GCP - CloudRun is the goto product/solution. This talk describes deploying a web application on CloudRun and how you can integrate your build pipelines using Cloud Build for the same. The talk would cover an end-to-end demo from building a docker container, pushing to GCR and then linking your repository to CloudBuild and ultimately deploying to CloudRun.</description></item><item><title>CI/CD for Serverless Applications on CloudRun</title><link>/speakers/dharmesh_vaya/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/speakers/dharmesh_vaya/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Google Developer Expert (GDE) who works as a developer evangelist at Auth0.

As web developers, we strive to build fast and robust web apps and servers. But, sometimes we unintentionally create memory leaks, which later on become a big issue that might even crash our app or server. In this session we will learn how to track JavaScript memory leaks.</description></item><item><title>Help!

Circuit-breaker, retry, timeout, blue-green deployment, A/B testing, pool-ejection&amp;hellip; replace our old monolith problem.
Istio is here to help us in those points, and even more!
In this presentation, we will see the tooling provided by Istio which can replace the Netflix stack and some dedicated frameworks in our micro-services environment. With this, we will see new paradigms of development brought by Istio to deploy and operate application with resiliency.</description></item><item><title>Istio, your kubernetes cluster best friend ‚ù§Ô∏è</title><link>/speakers/kevin_davin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/speakers/kevin_davin/</guid><description>A Google Developer Expert on Google Cloud and Gitlab Hero, I am above all passionate about tech, languages, infrastructure, and automation.

Addict of agility and DevOps, some of my missions were to help teams to follow those philosophies. From code quality analysis to unit or end-to-end tests setup all the way to continuous deployment and operation, I try to follow a project from birth to production.</description></item><item><title>Want more from your frontend framework!

I will compare Redux + REST with a full-stack, component-centric solution based on a graph API (think GraphQL) that I came to love. You might not be able to use the same framework - Fulcro - but you can still look for similar, more developer-friendly solutions that implement some of the same ideas and provide some of the same functionality.</description></item><item><title>Want more from your frontend framework!

I will be covering @angular/material and Material Design within Angular.
