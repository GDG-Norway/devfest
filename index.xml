This session will equip Flutter Developers with critical UI observation skills to drive insights required to build a stellar UI in Flutter, and that too, in minimum time.
In this Talk, I‚Äôll go over the User Interfaces of 2-3 most famous Mobile Apps. I‚Äôll handpick some of the core screens of these apps, explaining my observation on the UI elements for each of them, and then deconstructing each of those elements to their equivalent Flutter widgets and their collective placements and styling.</description></item><item><title>Tales of a Mobile DevOps</title><link>/sessions/mobile_devops/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/sessions/mobile_devops/</guid><description>There is a lot of material on developing mobile apps, but how about shipping it to the real world? In this session we will go through what is the role of a Mobile Infrastructure team and why is crucial to let your app reach your end users.
If you&amp;rsquo;re developing mobile apps, you probably know what&amp;rsquo;s one of your most important KPI: Store Rating.
In such an environment, speed is key.</description></item><item><title>Want more from your frontend framework!
